  Lesson: Vectors
  Author: Simon A. Queenborough, modified from Nick Carchedi
  Type: Standard
  Organization: JHU Biostat
  Version: 2.2.0

- Class: text
  Output: The simplest and most common data structure in R is the vector.

- Class: text
  Output: 'Vectors come in two different flavors: atomic vectors and lists. An atomic
    vector contains exactly one data type, whereas a list may contain multiple data
    types. We will explore atomic vectors here before we get to lists in another lesson.'
    
- Class: text
  Output: Today, you will learn how to create different kinds of vectors (numeric, logical,
    and character) and how to combine them into new vectors.

- Class: text
  Output: In previous lessons, we dealt entirely with numeric vectors, which are one
    type of atomic vector. 
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Remember that we created a vector from 1 to 20 using 1:20? Try that again.
  CorrectAnswer: 1:20
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='1:20')
  Hint: Type 1:20! ;)
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: And, that we can assign this vector to a variable, e.g., 'x'? Try that! Assign
    1:20 to the variable 'x'.
  CorrectAnswer: x <- 1:20
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x <- 1:20')
  Hint: Remember that the 'carrot' or 'arrow' (<-) is used to assign things to object names.
  
- Class: text
  Output: There are a number of ways that we can examine our new vector.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "We could just display the vector on the screen, by typing the name: 'x'. Try that."
  CorrectAnswer: x
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='x')
  Hint: Hmmmm... type 'x'!
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: But, what if we had a really, really, really _long_ vector that was much too
    large to display on the screen? We can use several functions to look at what 'x'
    contains. First, we can ask if 'x' even is a vector, with the function is.vector().
    Try that...
  CorrectAnswer: is.vector(x)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='is.vector(x)')
  Hint: Put 'x' as an argument to is.vector().
  
- Class: text
  Output: The response to this question function is 'TRUE', i.e., x is a vector. The 
    alternative response is 'FALSE'. We will look at these logical statements in more
    detail later in the course.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Second, we can also easily examine 'x' with str(), or structure, function. 
    Type str(x).
  CorrectAnswer: str(x)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='str(x)')
  Hint: str(x)
    
- Class: text
  Output: This function displays a summary of the various parts of the object. In this case,
    we only have one part, the vector of integers. The str() function is more useful for 
    objects with different parts, such as lists and the output of statistical tests. We 
    will use str() more in later lessons.
    
- Class: text
  Output: OK, vectors of integers are straightforward. Hopefully you understand these
    now, and can make and examine them. Remember that as well as ':', you can also use seq() and rep()
    as we did in the last lesson.
    
- Class: text
  Output: However, we may want to work with data other than integers. Other types of 
    atomic vectors include logical, character, integer, and complex. Now, we'll take
    a closer look at logical and character vectors.

- Class: text
  Output: Logical vectors can contain the values TRUE, FALSE, and NA (for 'not available').
    These values are generated as the result of logical 'conditions'. Let's experiment
    with some simple conditions.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First, create a numeric vector num_vect that contains the values 0.5, 55,
    -10, and 6.
  CorrectAnswer: num_vect <- c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='num_vect <- c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)')
  Hint: Recall that the c() function is used for creating a vector. If you forget
    how to use it, use ?c to access the help file. Don't forget to assign the result
    to a new variable called num_vect.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, create a variable called tf that gets the result of num_vect < 1, which
    is read as 'num_vect is less than 1'.
  CorrectAnswer: tf <- num_vect < 1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='tf <- num_vect < 1')
  Hint: Use tf <- num_vect < 1 to assign the result of num_vect < 1 to a variable
    called tf.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What do you think tf will look like?
  CorrectAnswer: a vector of 4 logical values
  AnswerChoices: a vector of 4 logical values; a single logical value
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='a vector of 4 logical values')
  Hint: Remember our lesson on vector arithmetic? The theme was that R performs many
    operations on an element-by-element basis. We called these 'vectorized' operations.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Print the contents of tf now.
  CorrectAnswer: tf
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='tf')
  Hint: Just type tf and press Enter to view the its value.

- Class: text
  Output: The statement num_vect < 1 is a condition and tf tells us whether each corresponding
    element of our numeric vector num_vect satisfies this condition.

- Class: text
  Output: The first element of num_vect is 0.5, which is less than 1 and therefore
    the statement 0.5 < 1 is TRUE. The second element of num_vect is 55, which is
    greater than 1, so the statement 55 < 1 is FALSE. The same logic applies for the
    third and fourth elements.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's try another. Type num_vect >= 6 without assigning the result to a
    new variable.
  CorrectAnswer: num_vect >= 6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='num_vect >= 6')
  Hint: Don't create a new variable on this one. We just want to see the result of
    num_vect >= 6. Make sure there is no space between the `>` and `=` symbols. Think
    of them as one symbol representing 'greater than or equal to'.

- Class: text
  Output: This time, we are asking whether each individual element of num_vect is
    greater than OR equal to 6. Since only 55 and 6 are greater than or equal to 6,
    the second and fourth elements of the result are TRUE and the first and third elements
    are FALSE.

- Class: text
  Output: The `<` and `>=` symbols in these examples are called 'logical operators'.
    Other logical operators include `>`, `<=`, `==` for exact equality, and `!=` for
    inequality.

- Class: text
  Output: If we have two logical expressions, A and B, we can ask whether at least
    one is TRUE with A | B (logical 'or' a.k.a. 'union') or whether they are both
    TRUE with A & B (logical 'and' a.k.a. 'intersection'). Lastly, !A is the negation
    of A (i.e., not A) and is TRUE when A is FALSE and vice versa.
    
- Class: text
  Output: Do not worry if these ideas do not make sense right now. 
    We will come back to logical expressions in a later class.
    On to character vectors!

- Class: text
  Output: Character vectors are very common in R. Double quotes are used to distinguish
    character objects, as in the following example.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'Create a character vector that contains the following words: "My", "name",
    "is". Remember to enclose each word in its own set of double quotes, so that
    R knows they are character strings. Store the vector in a variable called my_char.'
  CorrectAnswer: my_char <- c("My", "name", "is")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_char <- c("My", "name", "is")')
  Hint: Type my_char <- c("My", "name", "is") to create a new variable called my_char
    that contains a character vector of length 3. Make sure that the commas separating
    the words are OUTSIDE of the double quotes, or else R thinks the commas are part
    of the words.
    
- Class: text
  Output: "BEST PRACTICE: Is to use double quotes. Single quotes (a.k.a. the apostrophe) 
    will usually work but there are cases where using them will cause trouble.
    Double quotes are best for text."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Print the contents of my_char to see what it looks like.
  CorrectAnswer: my_char
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_char')
  Hint: Type my_char to view its contents.

- Class: text
  Output: Right now, my_char is a character vector of length 3. Let's say we want
    to join the elements of my_char together into one continuous character string
    (i.e., a character vector of length 1). We can do this using the paste() function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Type paste(my_char, collapse = " ") now. Make sure there's a space between
    the double quotes in the `collapse` argument. You'll see why in a second.
  CorrectAnswer: paste(my_char, collapse = " ")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='paste(my_char, collapse = " ")')
  Hint: Use paste(my_char, collapse = " ") to collapse the words in the vector so
    they almost form a sentence. There should be a single space between the double
    quotes in the `collapse` argument so that there are single spaces separating the
    words.

- Class: text
  Output: The `collapse` argument to the paste() function tells R that when we join
    together the elements of the my_char character vector, we'd like to separate them
    with single spaces.

- Class: text
  Output: It seems that we're missing something.... Ah, yes! Your name!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'To add (or ''concatenate'') your name to the end of my_char, use the c()
    function like this: c(my_char, "your_name_here"). Place your name in double quotes
    where I''ve put "your_name_here". Try it now, storing the result in a new variable
    called my_name.'
  CorrectAnswer: my_name <- c(my_char, "Swirl")
  AnswerTests: var_is_a("character", "my_name"); expr_uses_func("c"); expr_creates_var("my_name");
    val_has_length(4)
  Hint: Tack your name on to the end of the my_char vector using the c() function.  Be
    sure to assign the result to a new variable called my_name. If your name was "Swirl",
    you would type my_name <- c(my_char, "Swirl").

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Take a look at the contents of my_name.
  CorrectAnswer: my_name
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_name')
  Hint: Type my_name and press Enter to view its contents.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now, use the paste() function once more to join the words in my_name together
    into a single character string. Don't forget to say collapse = " "!
  CorrectAnswer: paste(my_name, collapse = " ")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='paste(my_name, collapse = " ")')
  Hint: Use paste(my_name, collapse = " ") to join all four words together, separated
    by single spaces.

- Class: text
  Output: In this example, we used the paste() function to collapse the elements of
    a single character vector. paste() can also be used to join the elements of multiple
    character vectors.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: In the simplest case, we can join two character vectors that are each of
    length 1 (i.e., to join two words). Try paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " "), where
    the `sep` argument tells R that we want to separate the joined elements with a
    single space.
  CorrectAnswer: paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " ")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " ")')
  Hint: Enter paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " ") to join the two words "Hello" and
    "world", separated by a single space. There should be a single space between the
    double quotes in the `sep` argument to the paste() function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For a slightly more complicated example, we can join two vectors, each of
    length 3. Use paste() to join the integer vector 1:3 with the character vector c("X", "Y", "Z"). This time, use sep
    = "" to leave no space between the joined elements.
  CorrectAnswer: paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "")', 'paste(c(1:3), c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "")')
  Hint: Use paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "") to see what happens when we join
    two vectors of equal length using paste().

- Class: text
  Output: 'What do you think will happen if our vectors are of different length? (Hint:
    we talked about this in a previous lesson.)'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Vector recycling! Try paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-"), where LETTERS is a
    predefined variable in R containing a character vector of all 26 letters in the
    English alphabet.
  CorrectAnswer: paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-")')
  Hint: Type paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-") to see how R recycles the vector 1:4 to  match
    the length of LETTERS. Notice we are using `-` as our separator this time instead
    of a single space.

- Class: text
  Output: Since the character vector LETTERS is longer than the numeric vector 1:4,
    R simply recycles, or repeats, 1:4 until it matches the length of LETTERS.

- Class: text
  Output: "Also worth noting is that the numeric vector 1:4 gets 'coerced' into a character
    vector by the paste() function."

- Class: text
  Output: We'll discuss coercion in another lesson, but all it really means is that the
    numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the output above are no longer numbers to R, but rather
    characters "1", "2", "3", and "4".
     
- Class: text
  Output: "Congratulation on completing another lesson! Now you know how to create numeric,
  integer, logical, and character vectors, examine their structure, and combine them together
  in different ways. Nice work!"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Please submit the log of this lesson to Google Forms so
    that Simon may evaluate your progress.
  AnswerChoices: Oh, yes please!
  CorrectAnswer: Oh, yes please!
  AnswerTests: submit_log()
