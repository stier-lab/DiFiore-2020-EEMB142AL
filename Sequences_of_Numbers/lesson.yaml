  Version: 2.2.0

- Class: text
  Output: In this lesson, you'll learn how to create sequences of numbers in R. 
    Sequences of numbers are used in many different tasks, from plotting the axes of graphs
    to generating simulated data.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The simplest way to create a sequence of numbers in R is by using the `:`
    operator. Type 1:20 to see how it works.
  CorrectAnswer: '1:20'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='1:20')
  Hint: Type 1:20 with no spaces. Make sure to use a regular colon and NOT a semi-colon.

- Class: text
  Output: That gave us every integer between (and including) 1 and 20 (an integer is a 
    positive or negative counting number, including 0).
  
- Class: cmd_question  
  Output: We could also use it to create a sequence of real numbers (a real number is a positive, 
    negative, or 0 with an infinite or finite sequence of digits after the decimal place). 
    For example, try typing pi:10.
  CorrectAnswer: pi:10
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='pi:10')
  Hint: Enter pi:10 and see what happens. pi is a predefined constant in R that takes
    on the value 3.1415....

- Class: text
  Output: The result is a vector of real numbers starting with pi (3.142...) and increasing
    in increments of 1. The upper limit of 10 is never reached, since the next number
    in our sequence would be greater than 10.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Note also that pi is one of the few constants built in to R. Type ?pi to check the others.
  CorrectAnswer: ?pi
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?pi')
  Hint: Enter ?pi. What other constants are predefined in R?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'What happens if we do 15:1? Give it a try to find out.'
  CorrectAnswer: '15:1'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='15:1')
  Hint: Type 15:1 and press Enter.

- Class: text
  Output: It counted backwards in increments of 1! This is sometimes useful for plotting 
    coefficients from models in reverse order.

- Class: text
  Output: "Remember that if you have questions about a particular R function, you
    can access its documentation with a question mark followed by the function name:
    ?function_name_here. However, in the case of an operator like the colon used above,
    you must enclose the symbol in backticks like this: ?`:`. (NOTE: The backtick
    (`) key is generally located in the top left corner of a keyboard, above the Tab
    key. If you don't have a backtick key, you can use regular quotes.)"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Pull up the documentation for `:` now.
  CorrectAnswer: ?`:`
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('?`:`', "?':'", '?":"')
  Hint: "In order to view the documentation for a symbol like the colon operator,
    you have to use backticks (or quotes). This is so R knows you are not attempting to use the
    symbol in the command. Here's what it looks like: ?`:`. Don't forget the question
    mark out front."

- Class: text
  Output: Often, we'll desire more control over a sequence we're creating than what
    the `:` operator gives us. The seq() function serves this purpose.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The most basic use of seq() does exactly the same thing as the `:` operator.
    Try seq(1, 20) to see this.
  CorrectAnswer: seq(1, 20)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='seq(1, 20)')
  Hint: Type seq(1, 20) and press Enter. The space after the comma is not required,
    but is recommended as it tends to make your code appear less cluttered.
    
- Class: text    
  Output: This gives us the same output as 1:20. Check the help file for seq().
  CorrectAnswer: ?seq
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='?seq')
  Hint: Type ?seq
  
- Class: text
  Output: The help files show the arguments listed for the seq() function. The first
    two arguments are "from =" and "to = ". In R, you do not have to specify the
    arguments by name if you write out their values in the same order as written in the function.
    However, for complex functions it is often best practice to do so and makes your code 
    much clearer.
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For example, seq(from = 1, to = 20) will give the same output as seq(1, 20). Try it!
  CorrectAnswer: seq(from = 1, to = 20)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='seq(from = 1, to = 20)')
  Hint: Remember to write out the arguments by name for seq()!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:  OK, let's say that instead of 1 to 20, we
    want a vector of numbers ranging from 0 to 10, incremented by 0.5. seq(0, 10,
    by = 0.5) does just that. Try it out.
  CorrectAnswer: seq(0, 10, by = 0.5)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='seq(0, 10, by = 0.5)')
  Hint: You are still using the seq() function here, but this time with an extra argument
    that tells R you want to increment your sequence by 0.5. Try seq(0, 10, by = 0.5).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Or maybe we don't care what the increment is and we just want a sequence
    of 30 numbers between 5 and 10. seq(5, 10, length = 30) does the trick. Give it
    a shot now and store the result in a new variable called my_seq.
  CorrectAnswer: my_seq <- seq(5, 10, length = 30)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='my_seq <- seq(5, 10, length = 30)')
  Hint: 'You''re using the same function here, but changing its arguments for different
    results. Be sure to store the result in a new variable called my_seq, like this:
    my_seq <- seq(5, 10, length = 30).'
    
- Class: text
  Output: If you look closely again at the help file for ?seq, you will not see an argument 
    "length = ", but only "length.out =". You can actually use any abbreviation of the 
    argument name, as long as it is different from any other argument. You could even 
    use just "l = "!

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To confirm that my_seq has length 30, we can use the length() function.
    Try it now. To do this, you need to include the object 'my_seq' as the value of 
    argument 'x' of length().
  CorrectAnswer: length(my_seq)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='length(my_seq)')
  Hint: Use length(my_seq) to view the length of the my_seq variable.

- Class: text
  Output: Let's pretend we don't know the length of my_seq, but we want to generate
    a sequence of integers from 1 to N, where N represents the length of the my_seq
    vector. In other words, we want a new vector (1, 2, 3, ...) that is the same length
    as my_seq.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'There are several ways we could do this. One possibility is to combine
    the `:` operator and the length() function like this: 1:length(my_seq). Give that
    a try.'
  CorrectAnswer: 1:length(my_seq)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='1:length(my_seq)')
  Hint: Try 1:length(my_seq), without assigning the result to a new variable.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Another option is to use seq(along.with = my_seq). Give that a try.
  CorrectAnswer: seq(along.with = my_seq)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='seq(along.with = my_seq)')
  Hint: Type seq(along.with = my_seq). Notice we're using the same seq() function, but
    with a different argument called `along.with`. This tells R that you want a sequence
    'along with' the sequence my_seq. Remember you can type ?seq if you have questions
    about the seq() function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: However, as is the case with many common tasks, R has a separate built-in
    function for this purpose called seq_along(). Type seq_along(my_seq) to see it
    in action.
  CorrectAnswer: seq_along(my_seq)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='seq_along(my_seq)')
  Hint: The seq_along() function is a variation of the seq() function. Try seq_along(my_seq)
    to get the same result yet another way.

- Class: text
  Output: There are often several approaches to solving the same problem, particularly
    in R. Simple approaches that involve less typing are generally best. It's also
    important for your code to be readable, so that you and others can figure out
    what's going on without too much hassle.

- Class: text
  Output: If R has a built-in function for a particular task, it's likely that function
    is highly optimized for that purpose and is your best option. One of the 
    philosophies of R (and Unix more generally) is to have tools (or functions) that
    do specific things very well and then link these together, rather than a singles
    multi-purpose tool that does many things poorly. 
    
- Class: text
  Output: This approach is like having a seperate knife, fork, and spoon, rather than 
    a Spork ... In most situations, cutlery ("silverware") is superior to the Spork.
    
- Class: text
  Output: As you become a
    more advanced R programmer, you will learn how to link and nest these apparently 
    simple functions to do incredibly powerful tasks. You will also design your own 
    functions to perform tasks
    when there are no better options. We'll explore writing your own functions in
    future lessons.

- Class: text
  Output: OK, back to the show. One more function related to creating sequences of numbers is rep(), which
    stands for 'replicate'. Let's look at a few uses.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If we're interested in creating a vector that contains 40 zeros, we can
    use rep(0, times = 40). Try it out.
  CorrectAnswer: rep(0, times = 40)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rep(0, times = 40)')
  Hint: Type rep(0, times = 40) to make a vector containing 40 zeros.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If instead we want our vector to contain 10 repetitions of the vector (0,
    1, 2), we can do rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10). Go ahead.
  CorrectAnswer: rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10)')
  Hint: Try rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10) for a different variation on the same theme.
    Be sure to use the c() function to tell R that the numbers 0, 1, and 2 make up
    a vector.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, let's say that rather than repeating the vector (0, 1, 2) over
    and over again, we want our vector to contain 10 zeros, then 10 ones, then 10
    twos. We can do this with the `each` argument. Try rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10).
  CorrectAnswer: rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10)')
  Hint: Type rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10) to see how the `each` argument to the rep()
    function alters its behavior slightly.
